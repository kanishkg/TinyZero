# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.

Evaluate whether the text contains any backtracking behavior, where in the text, the writer realizes a path won't work and explicitly goes back to try a different approach. An example of backtracking is: "Let me try again", "Wait" or "we need to try a different sequence". We want to mark instances where the writer abandons a thought and the writer backtracks to a previous computation. 

Count the number of distinct backtracking instances and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the writer does not backtrack, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.

# Task Format
Format your response in markdown as follows:

## Does backtrack?
[yes/no]

## Number of backtrack steps
<count> [1/2/...] </count>.

## Rationale
[Brief description describing what behavior was noticed and where backtracking may have occured]

# Task to evaluate for backtracking
