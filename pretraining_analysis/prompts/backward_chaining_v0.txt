# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the inernet.

Evaluate whether the text contains any backward-chaining behavior, where the writer is working towards a goal but starts from the goal and works backwards.

Count the number of distinct backward-chaining instances and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the chain-of-reasoning does not contain any backward-chaining behavior, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.

# Task Format
Format your response in markdown as follows:

## Does backwardchain?
[yes/no]

## Number of backward chaining steps
<count> [1/2/...] </count>.

## Rationale
[Brief description describing what behavior was noticed and where backward chaining may have occured]

# Task to evaluate for backward chaining
