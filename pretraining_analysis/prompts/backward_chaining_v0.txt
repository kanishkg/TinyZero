# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.

Evaluate whether the text contains any backward-chaining behavior, where the writer is working towards a goal but starts from the goal and works backward.

Count the number of distinct backward-chaining instances and provide the count between the tags `<count></count>`. If the reasoning does not contain any backward-chaining behavior, provide a count of 0 as `<count>0</count>`.

# Task Format
Format your response in markdown as follows:

## Does the text exhibit backward chaining?
[yes/no]

## Number of backward chaining instances
<count>[1/2/...]</count>

## Rationale
[Brief description of the observed behavior and where backward chaining may have occurred]

# Task to evaluate for backward chaining
{response}
