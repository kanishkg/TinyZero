# Task Description
You will be provided with a chain-of-reasoning that a Language Model generated.

Evaluate whether the chain-of-reasoning contains any backward-chaining behavior, where the model starts from the target answer and works backwards to the initial problem. Consider a problem to find an operator such that the numbers 12 and 2 can be combined with that operator to arrive at the target answer of 24. Here, an example of backward-chaining when is: "Let's work backwards from the target. 24/2 = 12. So, 12*2=24." and if the target is 22 and the numbers are 25 and 3 is: "Since the target is 22, and 22 + 3 = 25, ...".

Count the number of distinct backward-chaining instances and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the chain-of-reasoning does not contain any backward-chaining behavior, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.

# Task Format

# Response


Evaluate whether the chain-of-reasoning contains any backward-chaining behavior, where the model starts from the target number and works backwards to the initial numbers. An example of backward-chaining when the target is 24 and the numbers are 12 and 2 is: "Let's work backwards from the target. 24/2 = 12. So, 12*2=24." and if the target is 22 and the numbers are 25 and 3 is: "Since the target is 22, and 22 + 3 = 25, ...".
Count the number of distinct backward-chaining instances and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the chain-of-reasoning does not contain any backward-chaining behavior, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.
