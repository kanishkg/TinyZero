# Task Description
You will be provided with a chain-of-reasoning that a Language Model generated.

Evaluate whether the chain-of-reasoning contains any answer-verification steps. An example of an answer-verification step is: 'This sequence results in 1, which is not equal to 22' or 'Since 25 is not equal to 22'. We want to mark instances where the chain-of-reasoning explicitly checks the current result against the target number. 

If you find any answer-verification steps, please count them and provide the count as between the tags <count> </count>.

# Task Format
Format your response in markdown as follows:

## Does answer verification?

## Number of answer verification steps
<count> [1/2/...] </count>.

## Rationale
