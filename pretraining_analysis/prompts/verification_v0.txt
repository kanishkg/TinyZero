# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.

Evaluate whether the text contains any verification steps. We want to mark instances where the writer explicitly checks their own work, such as by comparing the result to a known value or by checking the result of a calculation. 

If you find any verification steps, please count them and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the text does not contain any verification steps, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.

# Task Format
Format your response in markdown as follows:

## Does verification?
[yes/no]

## Number of answer verification steps
<count> [1/2/...] </count>.

## Rationale
