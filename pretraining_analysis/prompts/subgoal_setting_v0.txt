# Task Description
You will be provided with a chain-of-reasoning that a Language Model generated.

Evaluate whether the chain-of-reasoning contains any explicit subgoal setting, where the model breaks down the problem into smaller, intermediate goals. An example of subgoal setting is: "First, I'll try to get close to <target//2>, then...". 

If you find any subgoal steps, please count them and provide the count as between the tags <count> </count>. If the chain-of-reasoning does not contain any subgoal setting, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.
